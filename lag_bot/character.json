All the numbers must be positive.\nFor ranged attacks, \"R={input number here},{method}\".  The number means how much the range of attack will be. The method must be one of the following: \"A,\" which means all the people will get that damage; \"F,\" which means only the first person will be damaged. \"L\" means the last person will be damaged.\nFor melee attacks, \"M={input number here}\". It is the amount the person will attack the person ahead of them.\nFor healing, \"H={heal amount}{method}\". The number is the amount that will be added back to the health. The method is the following: \"F\" means the first person will heal that amount, and \"N\" means the people next to this will heal that amount.\nFor blocking, \"B={max blocking amount}\". The number will be the max blocking amount. When played, a random value will be chosen within \"[0, max blocking amount]\" inclusively.\n\nSome emojis will have special abilities:\n\"SS={emoji}\" will summon this emoji once it dies,\n\"SH={heal amount}\" will heal + increase max heal of the emoji if it kills another emoji\n\"SM={heal amount}\" will increase all damage health it kills another emoji\n\nThe emoji can be multiple of each attack mode; however, a probability must be associated with each of them.
